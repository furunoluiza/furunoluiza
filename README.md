## About me
I'm a software engineering student at [42Rio](https://42.rio/) and a biological science student at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro ([UFRJ](https://ufrj.br/)). </br> 
I am interested in the area of bioinformatics, looking to learn computational tools to study biological problems and questions.
